## Marketplaces

- [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com): Traditionally been the "bread and butter" of freelance programmers, now even the Elance is merged with Upwork. Can work out for you if you can sort through the chaos and able to separate the wheat from the chauff. Personally, I'm liking this site less and less since they first increased the commission to 20%, then sent some difficult clients on my way.
- [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com): A good freelancing site in its own niche for quick and very short-term jobs with limited budgets. Despite the name, you get a lot of good projects that can continue well into long term, I can personally vouch for this site as I made a good number of sales here.
- [Freelancer](https://www.freelancer.com): The second most popular in the freelancing world after Upwork, though I don't like the fact that they want developers to pay the commission upfront, even before they are paid for their first job. You also need to be VERY careful, not to click on their shady membership adverts that trick you into handing back all your earned money to them!
- [People Per Hour](http://www.peopleperhour.com): Heard a lot about this site and the good quality of projects and clients that you usually get around here. Personally, I'm yet to make my first opening here.
- [Guru](http://www.guru.com): Used to be a good site earlier, I did receive some genuine enquiries a few years ago. But lately, a lot of shady and dubious people seem to be hawking this site in the name of hiring freelancers. I once had a few prospective clients ask for credit card information even before starting a project, stopped using this site then and there!
- [Golance](https://golance.com): Joined this site recently, seems very promising from what I've heard on reddit, personally, I'm yet to land on a project here.
- [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/#expect-top-tier-devs): Toptal is a global network of top software engineers and designers with a hiring rate of less than 3%. Toptal works with clients to understand their project/team needs and custom-matches them with pre-screened developers and designers who join their teams on a full-time, part-time, or hourly basis.
- [/r/ForHire](http://www.reddit.com/r/ForHire): Yet another good place to find jobs, though some of their rules are way too silly and appear prejudiced. For example, I was banned from this subreddit, just because my hourly rate was "too low".
- [Pilot](https://pilot.co) - Pilot is a software platform that removes all the pain from contract work. We find work, negotiate contracts, send invoices and chase payments for hundreds of forward-looking engineers and designers around the world.
