## üìÉ IDEs and Editors

- [notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/): Must have code-editor for Windows platform.
- [microsoft/vscode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode): Call it feature filled code editor or light IDE, perhaps the most popular of our times.
- [vscodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/): Open source version of vscode without telemetry, but only mainstream plugins work in this version like omnisharp (C#) and intelliphense (PHP), no copilot and other proprietary stuff.
- [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org): The Java veteran's effective IDE.
