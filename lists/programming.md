# Programming Resources

## IDEs and Editors

- [notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/): Lightest and must-have code-editor for winodws.
- [microsoft/vscode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode): Feature filled Editor or light-weight IDE, perhaps the most popular of our times. But the official version comes with telemetry and proprietary features, better go for vscodium instead if you prefer FOSS ðŸ‘‡
- [vscodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/): Open source version of vscode without telemetry, but only mainstream plugins work in this version like omnisharp (C#) and intelliphense (PHP), no copilot and other proprietary stuff.
- [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org): The Java veteran's effective IDE.
- [Netbeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/): Another popular Java IDE. Sadly, Apache didn't do much justice to it after Oracle pushed it to the incubator.
