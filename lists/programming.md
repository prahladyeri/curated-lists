## MOOC (Massive Online Open Courses)

- [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com/) - My personal favorite! They have a mind blowing quiz/gamified way of teaching programming and what's more, they provide free online/PDF certificates on successful completion too!
- [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) - Fun and gamified way of learning web development. You can even try this if you already are a programmer and just want to exercise your coding muscles.
- [Saylor Academy](https://learn.saylor.org) - Non profit Australian Academy offering various CS courses. Highly recommended!
- [Open2Study](https://www.open2study.com/courses) - Launched in April 2013 by a [collaboration of several Australian universities](http://www.thegoodmooc.com/2013/06/a-review-of-open2study.html). The number of programming specific courses is currently small, but should grow in future considering that they are more leaning towards career-oriented than core academic courses.
- [MIT Open Courseware](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm) - One of the best online resource to get learning content. However, you won't get any certificates on course completion.
- [Stanford Online](http://online.stanford.edu/about) - Another great university that provisions learning content through the online channel. Again, no certificates, but still great course content.
- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=php) - Comprehensive curriculum and large number of programming courses to choose from. No free certificates though.
- [edX.org](https://courses.edx.org/) - Yet another MOOC. They used to offer free certificates until few years ago but no longer now.
- [Khan Academy - video lessons](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/) - Good for learning *HTML/CSS* - both practice tests and video sessions.

## Puzzles, quizzes and riddles to exercise your coding muscles	

- [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/) - Keep solving coding problems and keep earning reputation points for you, your university and your country!
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) - One of the "old-school", but interesting sites that features solving math problems through various levels. There is no code-evaluation, you just have to write your own code, come up with answers and post the answer to go to the next level.
- [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) - Lots of programming problems for you to solve! A gamification approach which is fun and enjoyable. It is said that people abuse the hell out of languages to reach the top of leaderboard here. Requires a `Github`, `Reddit` or `Google` account to sign in.
- [CodingBat - python and java](https://codingbat.com/) - Coding puzzles and problems in *python* and *java*.

- [Paqmind](http://paqmind.com/) – An alternative approach to learning. Answer theoretical questions, solve challenges and compare your solutions with verified ones.

## Integrated Development Environments (IDE)

- [notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/): Less of an IDE and more of a code-editor to be honest but happens to be my favorite.
- [microsoft/vscode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode): This is more like a glorified notepad++ but highly popular and currently trending. It runs a bit slower though due to it being written in JavaScript.
- [atom/atom](https://github.com/atom/atom): Similar to above, Atom is another JavaScript editor, quite popular these days.
- [Netbeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/): The conservative Java veteran's IDE! Unlike the above two, this one is a fully fledged IDE and supports advanced things like code refactoring and navigation.
- [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org): Another Java veteran's IDE, a strong competitor to Netbeans.



## Reddit Programming Help
