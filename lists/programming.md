## MOOC (Massive Online Open Courses)

- [Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/map) - My personal favorite. But only try this one if you are already a programmer and just want to exercise your coding muscles.
- [Saylor Academy](https://learn.saylor.org) - Non profit Australian Academy offering various CS courses. Highly recommended!
- [Open2Study](https://www.open2study.com/courses) - Launched in April 2013 by a [collaboration of several Australian universities](http://www.thegoodmooc.com/2013/06/a-review-of-open2study.html). The number of programming specific courses is currently small, but should grow in future considering that they are more leaning towards career-oriented than core academic courses.
- [MIT Open Courseware](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm) - One of the best online resource to get learning content. However, you won't get any certificates on course completion.
- [Stanford Online](http://online.stanford.edu/about) - Another great university that provisions learning content through the online channel. Again, no certificates, but still great course content.
- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=php) - Comprehensive curriculum and large number of programming courses to choose from. A pity [they started monetizing their students](https://courserajunkie.wordpress.com/2015/05/26/courseras-free-statements-of-accomplisments-die-a-quiet-death/) by offering paid-only certificates recently.
- [edX.org](https://courses.edx.org/) - ~~Non profit, open source~~ Professional and Profiteerig institute and currently ~~the most recommended~~ not recommended.

## Integrated Development Environments (IDE)

- [microsoft/vscode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode): This is more like a glorified notepad++ than an IDE but one of the most popular and currently trending. It runs a bit slower though due to it being written in JavaScript.
- [atom/atom](https://github.com/atom/atom): Similar to above, Atom is another JavaScript editor, quite popular these days.
- [Netbeans](http://wiki.netbeans.org/): The conservative Java veteran's IDE! Unlike the above two, this one is a fully fledged IDE and supports advanced things like code refactoring and navigation.
- [Eclipse](http://eclipse.org): Another Java veteran's IDE, a strong competitor to Netbeans.

## Programming practice to exercise your coding muscles	
	
- [Advent of code](http://adventofcode.com/) - Lots of programming problems for you to solve! A gamification approach which is fun and enjoyable. It is said that people abuse the hell out of languages to reach the top of leaderboard here. Requires a `Github`, `Reddit` or `Google` account to sign in.
- [CodingBat - python and java](http://codingbat.com/) - Coding puzzles and problems in *python* and *java*.
- [PySchools - python](http://www.pyschools.com/quiz/view_ranking) - Programming practice tests specific to *python*.
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) - One of the "old-school", but interesting sites that features solving math problems through various levels. There is no code-evaluation, you just have to write your own code, come up with answers and post the answer to go to the next level.
- [/r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer) - A programming puzzle a day keeps woes and dispair away. A subreddit where programming problems are posted and peer-reviewed every day.
- [/r/learnpython wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index#wiki_practice_python) - Pointer to more *python* practice resources.
- [Code Wars](http://www.codewars.com/) - A must visit place for all programmers. The practice challenges are really addictive.
- [Khan Academy - video lessons](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/) - Good for learning *HTML/CSS* - both practice tests and video sessions.
- [Paqmind](http://paqmind.com/) – An alternative approach to learning. Answer theoretical questions, solve challenges and compare your solutions with verified ones.

## Q/A sites for troubleshooting a problem:

- [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) - No need to say anything there!
- [Unix and Linux Q/A](http://unix.stackexchange.com/) - This is where I usually go if Google cannot help me with a linux problem.
- [Super User](http://superuser.com/) - Though not specific to programming, but very useful nevertheless.
- [Dev.to](https://dev.to) - Recently open sourced, this discussion site is geared towards beginners. Its more of a programming social network than a Q/A site though.
- [Code Project](http://www.codeproject.com/) - If you are into Microsoft Technologies like ASP.NET/C#, this site is for you.

## Other Programming resources

- [Reddit Programming Help](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming) - A must-visit place for every programmer. You will definitely gain something from this site, whether its learning, tips, guidance or just the satisfaction of helping a fellow developer.
- [Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structure](http://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/) - Visit this site if you run out of ideas for program creation. Almost every algorithm invented by mankind could be found here (Except the patented ones of course!).
- [Design Patterns Catalog](http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/) - A collection of software design patterns and processes to follow, written by Martin Fowler, one of the best minds in the industry.
- [Great Github list of public datasets](http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/great-github-list-of-public-data-sets?overrideMobileRedirect=1) - A great source of published data in case you are developing an app.
- [UPC Database](http://www.upcdatabase.com/itemform.asp) - The canonical place on web to lookup barcode items. An invaluable resource if you are developing a Barcode app.
